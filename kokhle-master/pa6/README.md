## Programming Assignment 6

#### Arithmetic.cpp
<p> Main file for PA6, exercising BigInteger ADT. Arithmetic.cpp takes in an input file with 3 lines - one representing a digit A, a blank line, and then a digit B. The code will perform various arithmetic operations on the BigIntegers in the input file, then output them to a specified outfile spaced out with newlines. </p>

#### BigInteger.cpp
<p> Source code for BigInteger ADT, containing all functions. </p>

#### BigInteger.h
<p> Header file for use in testing files and Arithmetic.cpp. Contains function prototypes, class specifications for use in BigInteger ADT and other user files. Provided by Professor tantalo. </p>

#### BigIntegerTest.cpp
<p> Personalized testing harness which calls the various functions defined in BigInteger.cpp and checks for errors. </p>

#### List.cpp
<p> Source code for List ADT. </p>

#### List.h
<p> Header file for use in testing files and BigInteger.cpp. Contains function prototypes and declarations for use in List ADT and other user files. (Provided by Professor Tantalo) </p>

#### ListTest.cpp
<p> Personalized testing file which calls the various functions defined in List.cpp and checks for errors. </p>

#### Makefile
<p> Allows the user to perform various tasks related to compiling, such as: cleaning binaries, formatting code, testing for memory leaks, and of course compiling the binaries for program execution. </p>

#### README.md
<p> A table of contents for PA5. Lists each file, their purpose, and a general description. </p>

#### Notes:
<p> N/A </p>
