#### Shuffle.cpp
<p> Main file for PA5, exercising List ADT. Shuffle.c takes in a single integer input n, and performs perfect shuffles on each list size up to n until each list returns to its original state. Shuffle.cpp will then print the results of each list's number of perfect shuffles to stdout. </p>

#### List.cpp
<p> Source code for List ADT, now written in C++. </p>

#### List.h
<p> Header file for use in testing files and Shuffle.c. Contains function prototypes and declarations for use in List ADT and other user files. (Provided by Professor Tantalo) </p>

#### ListTest.cpp
<p> Personalized testing file which calls the various functions defined in List.cpp and checks for errors. </p>

#### Makefile
<p> Allows the user to perform various tasks related to compiling, such as: cleaning binaries, formatting code, testing for memory leaks, and of course compiling the binaries for program execution. </p>

#### README.md
<p> A table of contents for PA5. Lists each file, their purpose, and a general description. </p>
